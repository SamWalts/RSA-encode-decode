# RSA-encode-decode
Last discussion of Discrete math had to do a simple RSA encryption and respond in that way. So I wrote a simple program to help do that.
p=3, q=11, e=3, d=7.
Need to make the parts changeable, as well as clear up how to input the encryption input, and output. Currently it can only accept a message 
to encrypts as capital letter and spaces. No punctuation allowed. And to decrypt a message it must be in "09 34 43 23" form, with no punctuation.
All in all, I had fun figuring this out. Got to use lessons I learned from my Java class, and my discrete math class to throw this together in a day.
